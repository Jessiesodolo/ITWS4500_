Lab 2

OpenWeatherAPI


The OpenWeatherAPI had very good documentation so it made things easier to parse through, the most challenging
thing about this lab was first user goggle dev tools to see what the JSON returned from the API call looked like.
After seeing the data it was a matter of figuring out which pieces of information you wanted and how to abstract it.


The 5hour weather data updated every 3 hours so I choose to display, the next 5 days and their temperatures in the
morning, evening and afternoon. This was a simple way to display the data in a meaningful way. I know personally
if i'm looking at the weather i'm focused more so on highs/lows and overall temperatures. The wind speed and pressure
doesn't concern me too much.

I still haven't found an adequate solution to creating spaces/tabs when creating a list item in javascript.
