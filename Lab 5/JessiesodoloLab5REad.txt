Lab 5
Jessie Sodolo
Web Science Development

The main obstacle in this lab was adjusting to using node instead of PHP, node has many frameworks
and modules it can get confusing at times. Then figuring out how to send request to and from
your server.

At times the interactions between Angular and node make it hard to draw the definitive line between
frontend and backend. Some of the Angular errors were had to fix and understand as wel.

I was able to get the stream to write to a file correctly I believe.
