Lab 4


The main obstacle in this lab was just figuring out how Angular Js worked in terms of the application and the controller.
Once I figured out how that worked, it was pretty simple to use angular. Angular made using the API data much easier
and simpler than Jquery.


For Media queries I had to separate list items and at a certain device with I displayed in list items in blocks. So 
a user would scroll down their screen vertically opposed to horizontally across the screen.
