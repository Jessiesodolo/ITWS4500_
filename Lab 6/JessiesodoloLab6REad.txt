The converting to CSV was pretty straightforward there was an npm module that helped me do that. I
decided that through my angular controller would kept track of which option the user selected either
"JSON" or "CSV" then on a post request I sent that to my server to then do the conversion.
It was better to have the conversion on the node server's side because the heavier the load and
bigger the file the more CPU the user would use, that could slow the user's computer down, opposed
to the server taking a while to fully convert the file. 




Download Links were then given to the user to get the fully exported files, I used a socket that would send messages
from the server to the user on the status of the file and whether or not it existed. Every time the user clicked
"Export" the socket would receive a message.
